# Future-Mobility-Solutions-on-Unity-VR

Heeding the digital transformation occurring across the entire automotive industry and in the race towards creating the Vision Zero dream a reality, it is equally important to prepare the society for this autonomous future. 

Addressing this very fact, In collaboration with Fahrerlos, SAVE Ingolstadt and THI we have created a WebGL enabled, VR Capable,  virtual game on the Unity platform.
This game would allow everyone to experience the future of mobility, interact with them virtually and provide personal feedback which will help immensely in understanding aspects of human behaviours and then incorporating them into the development of future vehicles. 

Coming soon to Fahrerlos, Ingolstadt.
